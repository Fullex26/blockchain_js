## ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Workflows

### 7. MetaMask Setup
- [ ] MetaMask installed and configured for Sepolia
- [ ] Network: Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111)
- [ ] Your wallet has test ETH

- [ ] Issue a benefit:
  - Recipient: beneficiary wallet address
  - Benefit Type: "TestBenefit" 
  - Value: 100
  - Expiration: future date
  - Click "Issue Benefit"
  - Verify transaction success
- [ ] Check benefits table shows new benefit

### 9. Beneficiary Workflow Testing

**Open: http://localhost:3001**

- [ ] Switch MetaMask to beneficiary account
- [ ] Connect wallet
- [ ] View mock Verifiable Credentials
- [ ] Verify benefit card appears with correct details
- [ ] Check benefit status shows "Issued"

### 10. Vendor Workflow Testing

**Open: http://localhost:3002**

- [ ] Switch MetaMask to vendor account  
- [ ] Connect wallet
- [ ] Verify "registered vendor" status (not error)
- [ ] Redeem benefit:

- [ ] Check admin portal - benefits table shows "Redeemed" status
- [ ] Verify all transaction events on Sepolia Etherscan

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria

If all checkboxes are complete, your Civitas MVP is fully functional and ready for demonstration!

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Contract deployment fails:**
- Check wallet has Sepolia ETH
- Verify RPC URL is correct

**Frontend can't connect:**
- Ensure MetaMask is on Sepolia network
- Check contract address in `.env.local` files

**Backend errors:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check database connection string
- Ensure contract address is correct

**Transaction failures:**
- Check wallet has sufficient ETH for gas
- Verify you're on the correct network
- Check contract address is valid
